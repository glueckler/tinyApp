# Tny App

So I made this fun url shortener while in class at Lighthouse Labs.

Unfortunately the current url is much longer than the urls you'd like to save

I think it's a great proof of concept though, right?

## Dependancies

- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- connect-flash
- cookie-session
- randomstring
- etc


Have a day!
